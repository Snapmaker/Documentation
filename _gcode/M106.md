codes:
- M106
title: Set Fan Speed
long: Turn on one of the fans and set its speed. If no fan index is given, the print
  cooling fan is selected. The fan speed applies to the next block added to the planner,
  so it will not take effect until previous moves in the planner are done. Under manual
  control with an idle machine, `M106` will change the fan speed immediately.
notes:
- "`M106` with no speed sets the fan to full speed."
- Turn off fans with [`M107`](/docs/gcode/M107.html).
parameters:

  description: Speed, from 0 to 255. S255 provides 100% duty cycle; S128 produces
