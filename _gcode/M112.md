long: Used for emergency stopping, `M112` shuts down the machine, turns off all the
  steppers and heaters, and if possible, turns off the power supply. A reset is required
  to return to operational mode.

  need to wait for a space to open up in the command queue. Enable `EMERGENCY_PARSER`
  for an instantaneous `M112` command."
